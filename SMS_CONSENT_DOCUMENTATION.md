### File Structure

```
src/
├── SmsConsent.jsx          # Main consent page component
├── SmsConsent.css          # Consent page styles
├── Terms.jsx               # Terms of Service page
├── Privacy.jsx             # Privacy Policy page
├── LegalPage.css           # Legal pages styles
└── main.jsx                # Router configuration
```

### Routes

- `/` - Main website (YUSRA INSTITUTE homepage)
- `/consent` - SMS consent opt-in page (**submit this URL to Twilio**)
- `/terms` - Terms of Service
- `/privacy` - Privacy Policy

### Configuration

To customize the consent page for your brand, edit these constants in `src/SmsConsent.jsx`:

```javascript
const BRAND_NAME = "YUSRA INSTITUTE";
const WHAT_USERS_RECEIVE = "updates, promotions, and service notifications";
const FREQUENCY_TEXT = "Message frequency varies";
```

### Form Fields

1. **Phone Number Input**
   - Type: `tel`
   - Format: Automatically formats as `(555) 555-5555`
   - Validation: Requires 10-digit US phone number
   - Converts to E.164 format internally

2. **Consent Checkbox**
   - Default state: Unchecked (required by Twilio)
   - Required: Yes
   - Label includes all required disclosures

### Validation

**Client-side validation includes:**
- Phone number must be 10 digits
- Consent checkbox must be checked
- Clear error messages displayed inline

### Confirmation State

After successful submission, users see:
- ✓ Success icon with animation
- Obfuscated phone number (`+1 •••-•••-1234`)
- Unique Consent ID (10 hex characters)
- UTC timestamp
- Full restatement of consent terms

### Data Capture

When form is submitted, the following data is logged (ready for backend integration):

```javascript
{
  phone: "+15555555555",        // E.164 format
  consentId: "A1B2C3D4E5",      // Unique tracking ID
  timestamp: "2025-10-31T...",  // ISO 8601 UTC
  brand: "YUSRA INSTITUTE",
  what: "updates, promotions...",
  frequency: "Message frequency varies"
}
```

**Note:** Currently logs to console. In production, send this data to your backend for storage and compliance records.

---

## Backend Integration

### Required Implementation

To complete the integration, you need to:

1. **Create API endpoint** to receive consent data:
   ```javascript
   POST /api/sms-consent
   {
     phone: string,
     consentId: string,
     timestamp: string,
     brand: string,
     what: string,
     frequency: string
   }
   ```

2. **Store consent records** with:
   - Phone number (E.164 format)
   - Consent ID
   - Timestamp (UTC)
   - Brand information
   - What user consented to
   - Frequency information
   - IP address (optional but recommended)
   - User agent (optional but recommended)

3. **Update `SmsConsent.jsx`** handleSubmit function:
   ```javascript
   const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
     e.preventDefault();
     
     if (validateForm()) {
       const consentData = {
         phone: phone.replace(/\D/g, ''),
         consentId: generateConsentId(),
         timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
         brand: BRAND_NAME,
         what: WHAT_USERS_RECEIVE,
         frequency: FREQUENCY_TEXT
       };
       
       try {
         const response = await fetch('/api/sms-consent', {
           method: 'POST',
           headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
           body: JSON.stringify(consentData)
         });
         
         if (response.ok) {
           setConsentId(consentData.consentId);
           setTimestamp(consentData.timestamp);
           setObfuscatedPhone(obfuscatePhone(phone));
           setIsSubmitted(true);
         }
       } catch (error) {
         console.error('Failed to submit consent:', error);
         // Handle error appropriately
       }
     }
   };
   ```

### Compliance Best Practices

1. **Retention:** Store consent records for at least 5 years
2. **Audit Trail:** Log all opt-ins and opt-outs
3. **STOP Handling:** Implement automatic unsubscribe when users text "STOP"
4. **HELP Handling:** Respond with helpful information when users text "HELP"
5. **Double Opt-in (Optional):** Send confirmation SMS after web opt-in
6. **Export Capability:** Be able to provide consent proof if requested

## Testing the Implementation

### Local Testing

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Visit `http://localhost:5173/consent`

3. Test the form:
   - Try submitting without phone number → Should show error
   - Try submitting without checkbox → Should show error
   - Enter valid phone and check box → Should show success

### Production Deployment

1. Build the production version:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy to your hosting provider (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

3. **Important:** Configure your hosting for SPA routing so `/consent`, `/terms`, and `/privacy` routes work correctly

   **For Vercel:** Create `vercel.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "rewrites": [
       { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
     ]
   }
   ```

   **For Netlify:** Create `_redirects` file in `public/`:
   ```
   /*    /index.html   200
   ```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need to actually submit the form data anywhere?

**A:** Yes, in production you should store consent records in your database for compliance. The current implementation logs to console - you need to add backend integration.

### Q: How long should I keep consent records?

**A:** Twilio recommends keeping opt-in records for at least 5 years for compliance purposes.

### Q: Can I use this for international numbers?

**A:** The current implementation is optimized for US numbers. For international support, you'll need to update the phone formatting and validation logic.

### Q: What if a user texts STOP?

**A:** You need to implement webhook handling on your backend that receives Twilio's messages and automatically unsubscribes users who text STOP.

### Q: Is this TCPA compliant?

**A:** This implementation follows TCPA best practices including express written consent, clear disclosures, and opt-out instructions. However, consult with your legal team to ensure full compliance for your specific use case.
